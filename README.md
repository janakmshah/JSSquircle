The difference is subtle but powerful. Your typical `layer.cornerRadius` rounded rectangle has a constant corner radius, it is the same as placing 4 perfect circles in each corner, which can be a little jarring. A **squircle**, on the other hand, gently increases the curve at it goes from straight-edge to rounded corner. The corner is more of an elipse than a perfect circle.
